Songs that 100% work:
	The Stage
	Hail to the King
	Top Gun Anthem
Songs that kinda work:
	Peace of Mind

The songs that 100% work also happen to be fairly difficult. Hope you like a challenge!

If you have an XBox 360 guitar controller, you can use that, otherwise the controls are:
	A,S,D,F,G for frets
	Left and Right arrow keys for strum

This is important: IF THE GAME RUNS AT ANYTHING OTHER THAN 58ish FPS, the song WILL BE
	OUT OF SYNC. I figured out how to fix it, but didn't have to to implement it
	and un-break everything that it broke.
